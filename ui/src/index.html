A user friendly, open source explorer built for alt coins to have an effecitve explorer
and wallet software that is secure, fast, and user friendly, but also allows for 
extensionality through the use of an API to query all any data in the blockchain.

The wallet software is completely client side and uses BIP32 mnemonics to generate
addresses, this means the passphrase is all that's needed to recover all addresses/funds.

The explorer comes with tools to start in a secure environment with HAProxy SSL
termination with lets encrypt certificate, security settings include HSTS and CSP, it
is highly recommended (especially if the wallet is enabled) that this setup is 
used as it acheives a score of A+ on https://www.ssllabs.com/
